#NMOS_ANALYSIS(nfet_01v08)-no variation is done to the standard W/L ratio#

1) The minimum acceptable current value is 1uA
2) The Threshold Gate-Source voltage(Vgs) is 646mV
3) Setting Vds at 1.8V and sweeping Vgs, then at Vgs=1.8V the Ids value is 501uA
4) The transconductance at the above setting is 5.32*10^-4 siemens
5) Setting Vgs at 1.8 and sweeping Vds, then at Vds=1.8 the Ids value is 501uA
6) The rds value at the above setting is 19.3kOhm
