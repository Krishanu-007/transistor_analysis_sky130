# Transistor Analysis with SKY130

This project analyzes transistor behavior using the SKY130 PDK. The design, simulation, and layout are developed using open-source tools including:
- **Xschem**: Schematic design
- **Magic**: Layout design
- **Ngspice**: Circuit simulation
- **Netgen**: LVS verification

## I will be explaining the basics of everything I used shortly. Do keep a check on this.

### Currently Working on the Layout Generations. Daily Uploads are going to happen.
